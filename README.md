## scratch-python-ml:

I am currently reading up more on machine learning, and this directory
represents a collection of simple no-frills implementations of some
standard machine learning algorithms. There's nothing particular fancy
or specially optimized here, and (like several other people out there)
I am mainly going to focus on implementing the algorithms from Andrew
Ng's Coursera course in Python.

The syntax for the algorithms implemented here should *almost*
resemble the sklearn syntax, however I pass data to the algorithms at
initialization as opposed to through the fit function.
